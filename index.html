title: Wold Writes

Hi. I'm Joshua Wold. In 2019 I started writing fictional stories. This turned into a fun project where I wrote seven novels and a half dozen short stories. So far I've managed to finish three of them and self-publish. If you enjoy the novels, have suggestions, or want to share any encouragement I'd love to hear from you. My stories are akin to imagining relatively normal worlds with a single element shifted; often magical in some way. The main genre I write in is magical realism. Send me an email at joshua [at] joshuawold [dot] com.
